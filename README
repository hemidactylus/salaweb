README

To do:

    * various types of content: href, endpoint, directory.

        directory = a check is done on the role configured for that directory
        (NEVER static files through lighty)
        (default role=admin only TO DO!)
        (a special role='' is anybody)

        The descriptors' roles are a plus: what counts are the role in the dirs and the decorator in the endpoint

        Also, careful with the superdir escalation tricks
